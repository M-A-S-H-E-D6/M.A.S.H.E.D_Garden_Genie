## How the App Started   
The Garden Genie application was created during a 5 week project. Itâ€™s aim was to solve a problem. 
The problem this app aimed to solve can be split into several sections addressing various challenges in begining gardening:   

Information Overload: To simplify gardening, the app consolidates all necessary information in one place, providing users with easy access to tailored gardening guidance.
Financial Considerations: The app offers cost-effective gardening solutions, tips, and budgeting guidance to make gardening more accessible.
Beginner's Guidance: Comprehensive beginner's guides, plant recommendations, and interactive tools empower beginners to start their gardening journey confidently.
Regional Adaptability: The app recommends suitable plants based on the user's location, considering regional climate and growing conditions.
Accessibility and Mobility: The app provides alternative gardening methods and adaptations for individuals with mobility challenges.
Family Involvement: Family-friendly projects, educational resources, and tips encourage family members, including children, to engage in gardening together.
Space Constraints: The app offers space-efficient plant recommendations for those with limited outdoor space.
Time Constraints: Recognizing the time-consuming nature of gardening, Garden Genie provides suggestions for low-maintenance plants. By optimizing plant recommendations the app helps users overcome time constraints and enjoy gardening without feeling overwhelmed.
Garden Genie aims to simplify gardening, make it affordable, and create an inclusive and enjoyable experience for all users.


## How to use the App
Garden Genie was designed to be simple to use.    
On the landing page you will find a 'Get started' button. Once you have clicked this button you will be taken to a form which asks 5 questions based on the various challenges faced by new gardeners including: Time, Space, Region, Mobility and Budget.
Once you have made all your selections there is a 'Submit' button. Once clicked, the app will present you 3 personalised plant recommendations. You can then choose the plant of your choice by clicking on the image/name of the plant. This will take you to a page that provides you with all the information needed to grow the plant. There is a 'Back' button on this page which on click, will take you back to your 3 plant recommendations. 
At any point, the user can click on the logo to be redirected to the landing page.
